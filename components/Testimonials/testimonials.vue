            <p class="mb-3 font-normal text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400">My experience at Paathshala was very wonderful. I have learnt a lot here. The professors at Paathshala are very helpful. 
                Due to Paathshalaâ€™s personalized teaching mode, I was able to clear all my doubts effectively. Getting my doubts clarified on time improved my practice test scores. I would 
                strongly recommend JEE Advanced and JEE Main aspirants to enroll with Paathshala.
